# Single-Cycle-Pipelined-ARM-Procesor
This project implements a custom ARM single-cycle pipelined processor from scratch. The design includes essential stages like instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. It supports a set of fundamental ARM instructions and showcases pipeline functionality with hazard detection and data forwarding mechanisms. 
The following schematic was used for the processor.
